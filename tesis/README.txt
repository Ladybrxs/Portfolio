The objective of this project is to apply statistical analysis and data mining techniques to evaluate risk factors associated with cervical cancer. A logistic regression model was used to identify and predict the probability of incidence of this disease as a function of several clinical and demographic variables. In addition, a multiple correspondence analysis was implemented to explore relationships between categorical variables, as well as an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to obtain initial insights about the dataset.
